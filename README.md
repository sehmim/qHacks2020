##### Native app that uses Machine Learning to predict best car insurance quotes.  

[Check DevPost link for better README](https://devpost.com/software/qhacks2020-0cu3fq)


We provide:
  - Single input processs that user types in only once which goes out to different companies and predicts quotes driven by real data. 
  - Uses Machine Learning and Neural Networking to enhance performance and accuracy at a rate none to any other.
  - Our model is completelty built from scratch and has the ability to re-train and grow based on the given training data without compromising its accuracy.

### Demo

### Goal
Our Goal is to reduce the tedious process of getting insurance in general; where each individual has to fill out a form specific to each company only to later call the company and find out that the quote given online is completely wrong and way lower than what was expected.
### Solution
Our app eleminates this tedious process of having to fill out multiple company specific forms and lets the user only do it once; we then use these inputs and make predictions about the quote and its confidance level by harnessing the power of Machine Learning and Neural Networking.
